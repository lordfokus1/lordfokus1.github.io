	<div class="textan">Suicide a month before I met you Deep regrets, I never could forget you Somehow you made your way to my decade Ayo ayo ayo ayo my girl In the sun, I see you with your guard down Number one, you're moving to a hard town Do not dismiss the promise that you made me Ayo ayo ayo ayo, my time Overkill you took another red pill On the sheet is everything that you spilled We are the ones you want to know right now Ayo ayo ayo ayo, black light Come again to murder your report card Just a friend to kiss you in the court yard You are the one I want to be stuck with Ayo ayo ayo ayo big fight Favor Some Way too young Slave to none Way too young Say goodbye my love I can see it in your soul Say goodbye my love Thought that I could make you whole Let your lover sail Death was made to fail Sticky fingers find the way to take her Crumple up another piece of paper I know your days are numbered when it comes to Ayo ayo ayo ayo this life Slip away into the solar system Straighter rays, you find a way to twist them Some like it dark and now I know where to Ayo ayo ayo ayo find you Serpentine, I think she was an Aussie Bloody hell, a common kamikaze Give up the ghost before you go under Ayo ayo aye ayo wonder Kicking hard and looking for a rescue Watch me starve was never to impress you I would have killed the part of me to have you Ayo ayo ayo ayo story Say goodbye my love I can see it in your soul Say goodbye my love Thought that I could make you whole Let your lover sail Death was made to fail Babe I know love is a funny thing Born to die in the eternal spring Your flickering is more than just a small flame Welcome to the party, it's a ball game Pick up the stick it's time to get hit with Ayo ayo ayo ayo my bat Suicide is never going to save you When I cried, it was because I came too You are the one I want to know right now Ayo ayo ayo ayo kiss this</div>

When it's killing me When will I really see All that I need to look inside Come to believe that I better not leave Before I get my chance to ride When it's killing me What do I really need All that I need to look inside Hey oh Listen what I say, oh Come back and hey oh Look here what I say oh The more I see, the less I know The more I like to let it go Hey oh, whoa, whoa, whoa Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder Where it's so white as snow Privately divided by a world so undecided And there's nowhere to go In between the cover of another perfect wonder And it's so white as snow Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed And there's nowhere to go When to descend to amend for a friend All the channels that have broken down Now you bring it up I'm gonna ring it up Just to hear you sing it out Step from the road to the sea to the sky And I do believe what we rely on When I lay it on Come get to play it on All my life to sacrifice Hey oh Listen what I say, oh I got your hey oh Listen what I say, oh The more I see, the less I know The more I like to let it go Hey oh, whoa, whoa, whoa Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder Where it's so white as snow Privately divided by a world so undecided And there's nowhere to go In between the cover of another perfect wonder Where it's so white as snow Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed And there's nowhere to go I said hey, hey, yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, tell my love now Hey, hey, yeah, oh yeah, tell my love now Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder Where it's so white as snow Privately divided by a world so undecided And there's nowhere to go Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder Where it's so white as snow Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed And there's nowhere to go I said hey oh yeah, oh yeah Tell my love now Hey, yeah, yeah, oh yeah </div>

	<div class="textang">Psychic spies from China try to steal your mind's elation
And little girls from Sweden dream of silver screen quotation
And if you want these kind of dreams it's Californication
It's the edge of the world and all of western civilization
The sun may rise in the East at least it's settled in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication
Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin is this your chin or is that war you're waging?

Dream of Californication
Marry me girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard, it's Californication
Space may be the final frontier but it's made in a Hollywood basement
And Cobain can you hear the spheres singing songs off Station To Station?
And Alderaan's not far away, it's Californication
Born and raised by those who praise, control of population
Everybody's been there and I don't mean on vacation

Dream of Californication

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Destruction leads to a very rough road but it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar, they're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world from Californication
Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Sicker than the rest, there is no test but this is what you're craving?
